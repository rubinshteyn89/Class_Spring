###
Archiving vs Compression:

- Archiving - Collapses multiple files into one.
	- Can be done with a few files or multiple directories

- Compression - Makes a file smaller.
	- Removes redundent data, meta data, replaces with smaller codes.
	- can be applied to individual files, groups of files or directory trees.


#Archiving
tar - tape archive
	- Copies and Backs up specific directories or groups of files.
	- Will include star in later distributions of linux

star - secure tar
	- Same as tar but adds suport for access control lists and SELinux extensions

tar -cf = create tar archive
tar -tf = lists contents of archive
tar -xf = extract file







#Compression

gzip or gunzip
- compresses / uncompress file
- very common
- very efficient
- Lossless compression

gzip foo = removes file "foo", creates "foo.gz"
gunzip foo.gz = removes file "foo.gz", creates file "foo"


bzip2 or bunzip2
- Newer and more efficient
- Uses more CPU usage




Pipes:


I/O redirection

STDIN = keyboard input
STDOUT = visual output; usually in space place as command
STERR =
