range loops:


range(1) = once

range(1, 100, 2) == from 1 - 99 and oonly count every 2nd integer.
      ^    ^   ^ 
Starting  End  Increment

range cannot be negative.	


range[1,2,3,4] == variable will take 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and use it for each operation



While loop conditions:

break:

while True:
	print something
	if some condition:
		break # breaks the loop because condition is present.
print some output



continue:


for i in range(20)
	i*i/0
	if i == 0:
		continue #will continue the loop every time conidtion is met.
	print i
