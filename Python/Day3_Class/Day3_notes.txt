#Day 3 Notes

Function -- a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.
- Can be reused multiple times
- Will be easier to read / refactor / debug
- Can be used to structure a program or project with modulation and encapsulation

input() --- Can only have 1 argument
raw_input() == to get string

function example:
def mult(x,y):
  z = x * y
  return z
  


the stack: optimal order or functional operation? Needs to research...
